           All projects are a temporary effort to create value through a unique product, service or result. All projects have a beginning and an end. They have a team, a budget, a schedule and a set of expectations the team needs to meet. Each project is unique and differs from routine operations—the ongoing activities of an organization—because projects reach a conclusion once the goal is achieved. The changing nature of work due to technological advances, globalization and other factors means that, increasingly, work is organized around projects with teams being brought together based on the skills needed for specific tasks. Leading these projects are Project Professionals—people who either intentionally or by circumstance are asked to ensure that a project team meets its goals. Project professionals use many different tools, techniques and approaches to meet the needs of a project. Some projects are needed to quickly resolve problems, with an understanding that improvements will be made over a period of time. Other projects have a longer duration and/or produce a product or other outcome that will not need major improvements outside of projected maintenance, such as a highway. Still others will be a mix of both of these types of projects. Project professionals use a variety of skills and knowledge to engage and motivate others to reach a project’s goals. Project professionals are critical to the success of projects and are highly sought after to help organizations achieve their goals.

          <h2>PROJECT MANAGEMENT DRIVES CHANGE</h2>
        </div>

          <p class="fst-italic">
           Throughout human history, project management has always been practiced informally, but it began to emerge as a distinct profession in the mid-20th century when a group of forward-thinking individuals from the aerospace, engineering, pharmaceutical, and telecommunications fields realized a changing world needed new tools. Motivated by the need to address the scheduling and resource issues associated with increasingly complex projects, they met to begin to set down and standardize the tools for a new profession. And in 1969, the Project Management Institute (PMI) was born. Today, we live in The Project Economy, where projects are the driving force behind how work is done, change is realized and value is delivered. In The Project Economy, the worldwide growth of project management proves its value as a: as a recognized and strategic organizational competence as a subject for training and education as a career path It is now widely acknowledged that a basic knowledge of project management can provide value to people with a variety of roles in a vast range of endeavors. Project management skills can help a young student working on a science project realize success, or a corporate executive settle personality disputes. These skills can help a nurse streamline shift changes to improve patient response times on their ward. They can help an IT professional deliver innovative software in record time or help a government agency improve the services they provide in a more economical manner.
