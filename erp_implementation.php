           An ERP system integrates many functions across the business, such as financial management, human resources, sales and manufacturing, to deliver benefits such as increased productivity and efficiency. ERP implementation describes the process of planning, configuring and deploying an ERP. The process typically continues for a few months—and it’s complex, because an ERP system supports and automates many different functions. To ensure a successful implementation, the organization needs to carefully define its requirements, determine how to redesign processes to take advantage of the system, configure the ERP system to support those processes and rigorously test it before deploying it to users.

           As with any large project, it’s imperative that you to take things one step at a time with an ERP implementation plan. It’s normal to worry about ERP implementation failure, but thankfully, successful and calm ERP implementations are not only feasible, they’re actually quite common, especially when you first secure leadership and IT buy-in. Before we look at the ERP implementation checklist and process in detail, your initial focus should be on selecting the right ERP system software provider for your business.
